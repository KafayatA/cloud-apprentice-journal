# Cloud Apprentice Journal

This repository documents my work as a Cloud Foundation Apprentice, including case studies, Jira automation projects, scripts, and guides.  

Each file in the `tickets/` folder represents a case study of a ticket I worked on, detailing context, actions, tools, and learnings.  

This journal demonstrates my progress, practical experience, and contributions in a professional, reproducible format.
